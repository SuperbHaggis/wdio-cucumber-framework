# WebdriverIO Cucumber Framework Example

A test automation framework for [Converse's online store](www.converse.com) built with WebdriverIO and Cucumber.

## Description

This framework is inspired by projects I worked on at EPAM, though it does not include any code from those projects. It uses the following tools and packages:

- WebdriverIO (testrunner)
- Cucumber and TypeScript (test scripting)
- Allure (reporting)
- ESLint (code quality)

## Installation and Configuration

To install the framework, simply run `npm install` or `npm -i`.

In order to run login tests, you will need to set your username and password as environment variables (examples TBD).

## Running Tests

To run tests, use `npm run wdio`

To run individual scenarios (TBD)
